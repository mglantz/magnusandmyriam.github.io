# RSVP
- Please respond by 2022, March 31st. There's a lot of things to organize, so don't forget to respond before then.
- Let us know if you will attend by e-mailing us at magnusandmyriam@gmail.com, [click this link to email us](mailto:magnusandmyriam@gmail.com?subject=[RSVP for the wedding]).

Here's what we need to know from you.
- If you will attend :)
- Who will attend
- If you are vegetarian or vegan
- If you have any specific allergies (food, drinks, other) we need to know about
- If you plan to stay on location before or after the wedding and if so - for how long you will stay.

# Children
Of course we would want all friends and family to be able to come to our wedding, but the harsh reality is that the location has limited capacity.
Also, we want you to be able to celebrate together with us late into the night. Because of this, we ask you to only bring children if you have to. We hope you understand.

Call us if you cannot arrange to come without children.

# Corona
We want to ensure that we can celebrate safely and in alignment with regulations in Sweden.
We expect everyone attending to be vaccinated AND tested maximum 3 days before the wedding.
Quick tests will be available on-site.

## ATTENTION
Current rules in Sweden are that for events over 100 people (that includes our wedding) everyone OVER the age of 18 needs to have proof of vaccination and a valid ID to attend.

We will update the information here if the rules in Sweden changes.
